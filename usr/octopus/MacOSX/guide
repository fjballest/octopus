Simple things that can be added:

cd/dvd burning, via drutil(1)
mp3player: view supports opening mp3, but using scripts to control itunes
	would be better.
avi player: again, view supports opening avis, but scripts to control the player
	and provide a better interface would be better. The interface could probably
	be then same used for audio:

- spool of audio/video files
- play [name, time]
- next, prev
- fwd rev
- stop
