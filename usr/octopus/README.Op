This includes oxport and ofs as used in the Octopus.
These programs can be used on Inferno as distributed.

See man/4/oxport and man/4/ofs for details and examples.
A copy of the manual is at http://lsub.org/sys/oman

You may install the octopus (or just its binaries) and then use just Op,
if you want to. See INSTALL.Octopus
