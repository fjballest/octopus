.TH LMOUNT 1
.SH NAME
lmount \- octopus link testing mount tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B o/lmount
[
.B \-L
.I ms
]
.B "..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is similar to
.IR mount (1)
and accepts all its options,
but includes instrumentation to test services over poor latency links. The flag
.B -L
delayes each request sent to the server for
.I ms
milliseconds. Requests are delayed concurrently so that throughput is not affected.
.PP
Creating a file with name
.BI !!LAT= N
is a more convenient way of adjusting the delay to
.I N
milliseconds. Once the service is mounted, and its file tree populated, a
.EX
touch /mnt/!!LAT=n
.EE
would put delays in effect.
