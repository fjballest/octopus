.SH NAME
netget \- octopus network resource register tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B netget
[
.B \-d
]
[
.B \-r
.I regdir
]
.I name
.I spec
.B "..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Netget
registers the resource named
.I name
with attributes as specified in
.I spec
into the registry. The registry is found by
trying
.BR /mnt/registry ,
or the directory
.I regdir
given to the
.B -r
flag. If the registry is not found and
.B -r
was not used,
the module dials
.BR tcp!pc!registry
to mount the registry listening there.
.PP
The program updates the registry entry once in a while, updating atrributes that
reflect the location and the radius (round trip time in milliseconds) to the PC.
More than one resource may be given in the command line (two arguments each, as
said), to create multiple entries in the registry.
.PP
Entries registered by
.I netget
are subject to leasing because the program adds a
.B lease
attribute to them, and refresh it along with location and radius to the PC to renew
the lease. The lease interval is set to twice the refresh rate (one minute in the current
implementation).
.PP
A resource is specified by a pair of
.I name
and
.I spec
(both strings). Where
.I name
is the name for a network gadget, for example,
.BR audio .
.I Netget
defines the attribute
.B name
wich such name. The name used in the registry for the resource would be
.B o!
followed by
.I name
followed by the system name, like in
.BR o!audio!$sysname .
The convention is that the name includes the system name for the machine providing
the resource after the resource name, as shown.
.PP
The
.I spec
argument is a set of attribute/value pairs, in a single argument string, separated by
white space. At least one attribute named
.B path
is expected in the octopus, whose value must be the path for the resource in the
terminal providing the resource (see the example below).
.I Netreg
adds
.B /terms/$sysname
before the
.B path
attribute suppied, to make it portable across terminals and to ensure that
all such attributes are homogeneous.
.PP
The program adds attributes
.B sys
(with the sysname name),
.B user
(with the user name for the user running the program),
.B loc
(with the location as for the machine as said in
.B /pc/what/$sysname/where
),
.B rad
(with the radius for the service, ie., milliseconds of RTT to the central PC), and
.B arch
(with a string reflecting the host architecture and system name).
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Register the directory
.B /what
from the terminal in the central PC:
.IP
.B "o/netget what 'path /what' 
.SH SOURCE
.B /usr/octopus/port/lib/netget.b
