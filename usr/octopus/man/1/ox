.SH DESCRIPTION
.I O/x
is a
program
that implements a shell to browse the file system, edit, and
execute commands while using
.IR o/mero .
Flag
.B -d
activates debug diagnostics and option
.B -o
can be used to select
.B odir
instead of
.B /mnt/ui
as the root directory for the window system.
Flag
.B -l
can be used to ask
.I o/x
to load an already existing interface found at directory
.I ldir
instead of
creating its own. The interface should come from a
previous instance of
.I o/x
(e.g., by using
.IR tar (1)
to save and restore it). See the example below.
.PP
In many cases,
.I o/x
runs under flag
.B -9
causing all file names to be interpreted in the
host underlying Inferno (expected at
.BR /mnt/fs )
and all commands to be executed by the host
system.
As an optimization, flag
.B -n
may be used when the Inferno used does not
call
.IR rfork (2)
using the
.B RFNAMEG
flag for executing host commands. That is the
case at Lsub.
.PP
Flag
.B -p
makes
.I o/x
persist, so it re-spawns a new instance of the program
after it dies. This is used to make sure that there is always
a shell program running at the PC.
.PP
Flag
.B -i
makes
.I o/x
run
.I initcmd
as if it was executed on the tag line of the initial directory
shown.
.PP
For the most part,
.I o/x
can be handled via the
.I o/mero
tag and panel commands described
in
.IR olive (1).
Besides,
.I o/x
includes its own command language consisting of
builtin commands, Sam commands, host commands,
and inferno commands. Beware that unlike other editors
in Plan 9 and Inferno,
.I o/x
applies the commands to the user selection (determined
by the last text panel where the used mouse button 1,
as explained in
.IR olive (1)).
.PP
Host commands are commands executed by the host
system underlying Inferno (eg., Plan 9). Inferno commands
are commands executed by the Inferno system where
.I o/x
runs. Edition commands are similar to those of the Sam
editor, and builtin commands
are any of the following ones:
.PP
.TF "Dup screen
.TP
.BI Ctl " ctl
Executes the control request
.I ctl
on the text panel of the last user selection. See
.IR omero (4)
for the full list.
.TP
.B Cmds
Shows the list of commands that have not yet finished.
.TP
.BI Dup " screen
(understood at the directory panel shown by
.IR o/x )
creates a new directory panel to browse the file system.
The optional
.I screen
names the screen where the new panel is to be shown.
Panels for files (and directories without the
.I screen
argument) are shown in the screen of the directory panel
used to open them.
If the
.I screen
does not exist in
.I o/mero
it is created before showing the new directory panel on it.
.TP
.B Edit
Makes the buffer consider that commands executed on it are Sam commands
by default.
.TP
.B Rc
Makes the buffer consider that commands executed on it are host commandsferno
by default (i.e.,
.IR rc (1)
commands on Plan 9).
.TP
.B Sh
Makes the buffer consider that commands executed on it are Inferno commands
by default (i.e.,
.IR sh (1)
commands).
.TP
.B End
Terminates the program.
.TP
.B Keep
prevents
.I o/x
for automatically closing the panel when too many
panels are open.
.TP
.B Scroll
Toggles the default behaviour regarding
scrolling for new output panels.
.PD
.PP
A command is considered a Sam command by default,
unless preceded
by a
.LR % ,
a
.LR ! ,
or a
.L ;
sign:
.TF "%cmd ...
.TP
.I "cmd ...
Executes
the Sam command
.IR cmd .
.TP
.BI % "cmd...
Executes the Inferno command
.IR cmd .
.TP
.BI ; "cmd ...
Executes the host command
.IR cmd .
.TP
.BI ! "cmd ...
Executes
.I cmd
at the host when
.I o/x
is under flag
.B -9
and at  Inferno otherwise. This is the most used
idiom, and executes the commands in the system
where the files being browsed reside.
.PD
.PP
See
.IR sam (1)
for a description of the language. The commands
.LR b ,
.LR k ,
.LR q ,
.LR u ,
and
.L !
are not implemented by
.IR o/x ,
and two new commands are available:
.TF P/regexp/cmd
.TP
.BI P/ regexp / " cmd
For each panel whose name matches
.I regexp
execute
.IR cmd .
Here, only
.BR f ,
.BR D ,
and
.B e
are valid commands.
The default is
.LR f .
The former prints the
name of the panel,
.B D
closes the panel, and
.B e
replicates the panel to the screen used to
execute the command (or to the path given
as an argument as shown in examples).
.TP
.BI Q/ regexp / " cmd
Similar to
.BR P ,
but executes
.I cmd
for panels not matching
.IR regexp .
.PD
.PP
Commands executed as if they were
executed using a
.L !
escape.
.PP
.I O/x
posts events using
.IR ports (4)
to notify about commands executed (starting with
.LR exec: ,
the command text,
.LR # ,
and the directory for the command) and files open
(starting with
.L look:
and the file path). Only the first line of the command
is posted when it contains multiple lines.
.SH EXAMPLES
Save the session for
.I O/x
to use it later:
.EX
	% cd /mnt/ui/appl
	% tar c col:ox.* >/tmp/oxui.tar
.EE
.PP
Start
.I o/x
to continue a saved session:
.EX
	% cd /mnt/ui/appl
	% tar x </tmp/oxui.tar
	% ox -l /mnt/ui/appl/col:ox.*
.EE
.PP
To get a new
.I o/x
directory panel in the a new screen,
named
.B s1
you may execute:
.EX
	Dup s1
.EE
in any directory panel shown by
.IR o/x .
.PP
To copy all the panels from the
.B stats
row in the
.B main
screen to the
.B stats
section of the
.B other
screen, execute this command
in
.IR o/x :
.EX
	P/main.*stats/ e /other/row:stats
.EE

.SH BUGS
The editor language por panels still needs more work.
