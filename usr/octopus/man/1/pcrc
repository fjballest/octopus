pcrc, termrc, pcns, termns \- octopus start-up scripts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcrc
.br
.B termrc
.br
.B pcns
.br
.B termns
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pcrc
starts the central computer services for the octopus. It converts a
local inferno in the PC for the octopus. The PC may
.B not
be used as a terminal. It provides a central name space and the
means to run applications on the PC via
.IR ox (1)
but does not even start a graphics terminal.
.PP
.I Termrc
plugs in the local inferno as a terminal for the PC. It converts the
local inferno into an octopus terminal. When the PC is to be used also
as a terminal, it is customary to start a second inferno on the PC (with
plenty of memory in the pool for graphics) to run
.I termrc .
.PP
Both scripts are meant to be customized for particular users, although
they might perhaps fit as provided.
.PP
The script
.I pcrc
starts DNS, the connection service, and authentication services. It defines the
.B $PC
environment variable, and spawns listeners for services expected at the PC in
the octopus. In particular, it provides a registry and also import and export
ports via Op to import terminal devices and to export the central name space to
terminals. It is responsible for starting the window system and
.IR ox (1)
among other things.
.PP
The script
.I termrc
asks for the location of the terminal and for the name of the central PC. It defines
environment variables
.B $location
and
.B $pc
reflecting that. Then, it updates context information for the terminal
(kept at
.B /term/what )
and dials the PC both to export local devices to the PC and to
import the central name space from the PC (using Op in both cases). It
starts
.IR olive (1)
to let the user browse the  PC and execute commands on it. It also
starts a shell with a mounted
.B /pc ,
which now contains the shared name space from the central PC.
.PP
Both scripts rely on
.I pcns
to start the central name space for the PC and also on
.I termns
to start a namespace for the terminal. Both scripts may be customized
by local installations to change the name spaces used by default for the PC
and terminals.
