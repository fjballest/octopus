.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Plumbing
spawns a child process to listen for messages in the
.IR plumber (8)

given as an argument. For each message received, it executes
.I cmd
as a shell command. The command has the environment variable
.I $msg
defined to contain the plumbed message data.

makes the program verbose, to report messages received.

Note that in the octopus using
.IR ports (4)
is preferred to
.IR plumber (8)
for reporting events, because it does not require plumber ports
to be created in advance.

.B o/newterm
each time a message is sent to the
.B netget
plumber port.
