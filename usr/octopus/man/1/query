.SH NAME
query \- octopus resource query tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B query
[
.B \-u
.I mnt
]
[
.B \-m
.I mnt
]
.I name
.I val
.B "..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Query
asks the registry for octopus resources matching attributes specified with
.I name
and
.I val
arguments (attribute name and value). By default,
.I query
prints a list of paths for matching resources in the registry. The paths should be
ready to be used within a octopus name space, see
.IR namespace (4).
.PP
The special value
.B $user
for the attribute
.B loc
refers to the user location as reported by
.BR /mnt/who/$user/where .
In the same way,
.B $term
refers to the terminal location for the
.B loc
attribute and
to the terminal architecture for the
.B arch
attribute.
.PP
Flag
.B -m
asks
.I query
to
.IR bind (1)
any of the matching resources at
.I mnt .
Flag
.B -u
works in the same way, but creates a union with all the resources found, instead
of binding just one.
.PP
Note that using
.B -m
or
.B -u
flags would make the current name space dependent on a particular
octopus resource. This means that when the terminal that provides it goes
away, the mount point will break and fail for further operations. That is, this is
a static, regular, Inferno mount, and does not adapt to changes. Use
.IR mux (4)
to adapt.
