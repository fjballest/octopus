.TH REBOOT 1
.SH NAME
reboot \- reboot terminal after connection loss
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B o/reboot
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Reboot
polls the file
.B /mnt/registry/index
for existence and reboots the terminal software (i.e., kills
Inferno on hosted systems) upon errors. That file comes from
the PC and must be available as long as the terminal is connected
to the PC.
.PP
This can be used by a native program to restart the terminal software if the connection
to the PC is lost, by waiting and trying again to start an Octopus terminal
if it dies.
