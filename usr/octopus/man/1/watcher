.TH WATCHER 1
.SH NAME
watcher \- octopus watcher for network resource arrival and departure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B watcher
[
.B \-dv
]
[
.B -r
.I regdir
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Watcher
watches out the registry to detect and notify of arrivals and departures of terminals
in the octopus. It opens
.B /mnt/registry/event
to detect changes in the registry (or uses the registry mounted at
.I regdir
when
.B -r
is given)
and scans the registry each time it changes.
.PP
For each new entry in the registry with value
.B ofs
for the
.B name
attribute
.I watcher
plumbs a message notifying of the arrival of the terminal whose name is reported by
the
.B sys
attribute as found in the entry. When such entry is gone (either due to lack of refresh or
due to removal from the registry)
.I watcher
plumbs a message notifying the departure of the terminal. Messages are plumbed both
via
.IR plumber (8)
and
via
.IR ports (4).
.PP
Upon departure of a terminal, as reflected by a gone registry entry for
.BR ofs ,
.I watcher
kills
the entire process group of the process whose PID was reported in the
.B pid
attribute of the
.B ofs
entry. This is done to force all resources imported from a (no longer working) gone
terminal to be discarded. Also,
.I watcher
tries to unmount the terminal from
.B /devs
(just in case).
.PP
Flag
.B -v
makes the program a little verbose, to report arrivals and departures. Flag
.B -d
makes the program quite verbose, for debugging.
