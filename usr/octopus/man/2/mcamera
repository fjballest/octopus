.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.I init
initializes the module. Call it first.
.PP
.I Takejpg
takes a photograph using the host system (e.g. apple's isight).
First of all, it checks if the required mechanisms are installed in
the host system.
It returns an array of bytes containing a JPEG image. The size
of the image is 640x480. It also returns the number of bytes
in the array.
.PP
This is a host-dependent module. Refer to the source section to see
the supported platforms. The file server
.IR camera (4)
uses this module.
.SH SOURCE
.B /usr/octopus/MacOSX/mcamera.b
.SH BUGS
Only for MacOSX. MacOSX version actually uses a command named
isightcapture, that should be installed in the host system, in a directory
included in the host's $PATH (e.g /usr/bin). This command can be 
downloaded from http://www.intergalactic.de.
An Inferno driver should be developed.
