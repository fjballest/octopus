.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Netget
simplifies (and unifies) how network services are registered in the octopus.
It can be used to register any service provided by a file server, or by any other
means.
Refer to
.IR netget (1)
for a description of how to use this module as a command, and for the behaviour of the module.
.PP
.I Init
should not be called. It is meant to provide a command interface for the module.
.PP
.I Announce
announces
the service with name
.I name
and
attributes as said in
.IR spec .
See
.IR netget (1)
for a description of these arguments and an example. It does so by
registering with the registry mounted at
.B /mnt/registry
or reached by dialing
.B tcp!pc!registry
(if
.B /mnt/registry
did not contain a registry).
.PP
The function
.I ndb
returns a string with attribute/value pairs using the format
of
.IR ndb (6),
and can be used to determine what has indeed been registered.
.PP
.I Terminate
ceases registration for the service.
