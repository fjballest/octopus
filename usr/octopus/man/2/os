.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Os
provides operations common in most servers that export resources from the host
OS. The module must be initialized by calling
.I init
before using any of its other facilities.
.PP
.I Filename
returns a string for the file named
.I name
in a format understood by the underlying system. In particular, it takes care of
adding the value of
.B $emuhost
as a prefix to the file name given. It is useful to execute host commands that refer to
files known to us, but kept in the host file system.
.PP
.I Run
executes
.I cmd
in the host system shell using
.I dir
as current directory and returns a tuple with the command output and
an error string. The parameter
.I dir
may be nil, in which case the current directory is not changed for the command.
.PP
.I Frun
provides is similar to
.I run
but returns file descriptors to let the caller stream input, output, errors,
recover the process wait status, and issue control requests to the process.
Upon errors
.I frun
returns a non-null error string and a null reference to a descriptor set.
.PP
.I Emuhost
and
.I Emuroot
keep the value of the respective environment variables.
