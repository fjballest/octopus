.TH DAV 4
.SH NAME
dav \- web dav file server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B o/dav
[
.B \-dr
]
[
.B \-a
.I addr
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dav
is a WebDAV file server that exports an Inferno name space through the
WebDAV protocol, as described in RFCs 2518 and 2616.
.PP
Its primary usage is to let the host operating system (for systems other
than Plan 9) use the name space of the Inferno.
.PP
By default, it spawns a backgroup process that listens
for clients at port
.I 9999
on the loopback network interface. Option
.B -a
may be used to make it listen at
.I addr
instead.
.PP
Flag
.B -r
makes the server read-only, for safety.
.PP
Flag -d
activates debug diagnostics. Repeating the flag one or more increases the
verbosity.

.SH SEE ALSO
.IR rfc2518 ,
.IR rfc2616 ,
and
.IR rfc3744 .
for the protocol.
.SH BUGS
The program is new and has been tested only with MacOS X Leopard.
ACL processing is incomplete at most.
Use with caution.
Also, there should be a way to export only part of a namespace.
A bug in
.IR bufio (2)
requires using the fixed version found at lsub for this module.
