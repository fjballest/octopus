.SH SYNOPSIS
.B o/mero
[
.B -abcdi
]
[
.B -m
.I mnt
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  O/mero
is the Octopus window system,
as introduced in
.IR olive (1).
Here we describe the file system interface.
.PP
By default,
.I o/mero
mounts itself at
.BR /mnt/ui .
Flags
.B -abc
are similar to the
.IR bind (2)
flags of the same name. Option
.B -m
can be used to select
.I mnt
as the mount point instead of the default
.BR /mnt/ui .
Under flag
.B -i
the standard input is used as a connection to the client.
.PP
.I O/mero
provides GUI components known as
.IR panels ,
like rows, columns, buttons, sliders, and others described below. Perhaps
surprisingly,
.I o/mero
does not draw and does not interact with the mouse or keyboard.
.I O/live
is a viewer for
.I o/mero
that does it, as said in
.IR olive  (1).
.PP
The root directory contains a directory named
.B appl
where applications create their panel hierarchies, one extra
directory per screen or session, and a file named
.B olive
used by the viewer to receive updates from the window system and to send
requests to it.
.PP
Each panel is represented by a directory that contains some files, the most
important are files named
.BR ctl ,
and a
.BR data .
Panels can be created and deleted by making and removing such directories.
Rows and columns have one extra subdirectory for each one of
the panels they contain, and do not contain a
.B data
file.
The file system can be used to move, copy (i.e. replicate), and delete panels.
The applications affected are usually unaware of this fact.
.PP
The name of a directory determines the type of panel it represents. A name is of the form
.I type:name
(eg.
.BR text:ox.3442 ).
Usually,
.I name
is a string randomized by the application to permit any two names to
cohexist within the same directory (i.e., within the same container panel).
.I Type
is any of the following:
.TF image
.TP
.B row
A container panel arranging children in a row.
.TP
.B col
A container panel arranging children in a table.
.TP
.B image
An image in Plan 9 format.
.TP
.B text
An editable text panel.
.TP
.B tbl
An editable text panel that insists on tabulating the words contained.
.TP
.B label
A single line (small) read-only text panel.
.TP
.B button
A single line (small) read-only text panel customized to behave as a button.
.TP
.B tag
A single line editable text panel. Usually to inform the user of sibling panels and
to provide a place to type some text.
.TP
.B gauge
A meter to show a value between 0 and 100.
.TP
.B slider
An editable meter to show a value between 0 and 100 and let the user adjust it.
.TP
.B page
An image in  Plan 9 format supporting paning. To view large images.
.TP
.B draw
A vector graphics device. Used to draw geometrical figures.
.PD
.PP
.I O/mero
(or rather,
.IR o/live )
uses the file
.B /dev/snarf
as the clipboard, to put there the bytes when a cut operation snarfs them.
The file
.B /mnt/snarf/sel
is updated
with the file system path for the last
.B text
panel where some text was selected. This does not consider tag lines and
is a convenience for executing commands that operate on selected text.
.SS Panel Files
Panel directories contain a
.B data
and a
.B ctl
file. The
.B data
file contains a portable representation of the graphical
panel, text for most panels and Plan 9 images for images. The
.B ctl
file
contains a textual representation of the panel attributes. Some attributes
are common to all panels and are described together later. The textual
representation for an attribute may be issued as a control request by
writing it to the control file of a panel. Each control request is terminated by
a newline character.
.PP
Both files are complete descriptions (i.e. they are not streams), which means that
tools like
.IR tar (1)
can be used to take a snapshot of a hierarchy of panels.
.PP
Applications are expected to read, write, create, and remove panel files
using the
.B /mnt/ui/appl
file tree. Panels found there are not shown by default at any screen. Instead,
a panel can be replicated at other places under
.B /mnt/ui
by issuing control requests. A panel replicated at a directory
.BI /mnt/ui/ dir
has a mirror of its file tree at that directory. Operations made to the files
at
.B /mnt/ui/appl
affect all the replicas (the panel itself). Operations made to the files at
.BI /mnt/ui/ dir
(ususally done by viewers) are made to that replica. Most of the operations
also update the panel (and any other replicas), but some (eg., hidding the
panel) do not.
.SS Attributes and control requests
These are both attributes and control requests common to all panels.
Depending on the panel type, additional attributes and/or control requests may exist
as described later.
.TF "appl id pid
.TP
.B "tag
Activates a tag for the panel.
This permits using the mouse and keyboard commands described in
.IR olive (1)
for tags.
.TP
.B "notag
Ceactivates it.
.TP
.B "hide
Hides the panel,
.TP
.B show
Makes a hidden panel visible.
.TP
.BI appl " id pid
Sets the panel as an application panel, identified by
.I id
(reported back along with events for the panel), handled
by the process with the given
.IR pid .
If a
.I pid
is set to
.B -1
the panel is not associated to any process. Otherwise,
an interrupt request causes
.I o/mero
to try to interrupt that process.
.TP
.B layout
The counterpart of
.BR appl .
It flags the panel as one used just for layout purposes.
.TP
.BI copyto " dir" [ pos ]
Informs of a replica of the panel (or establishes a new one when issued
as a control request). The destination
.I dir
should be an absolute path starting from the
.I o/mero
root directory (eg.
.BR /mnt/ui )
and showing where to ``copy'' the panel.
The optional
.I pos
argument  is a number indicating the position for the panel in the
target container (
.L 1
for the first,
.L 2
for the second, etc.)
.PD
.PP
The following control requests may be issued but do not correspond to
panel attributes:
.TP
.BI moveto " dir" [ pos ]
Is similar to
.B copyto
but it is meant only as a control request at a replica. It relocates
the replica to a different path. It is equivalent of a
.B copyto
request followed by a close request for the original replica.
.TP
.B top
Makes the panel full-screen (by zooming to it).
.TP
.BI pos " n
Sets the position of the panel to
.I n
in its container.
.TP
.B hold
Prevents
.I o/mero
from sending events notifying of changes to the panel (and its children)
until the moment when the control file is closed or the next request is issued.
.TP
.B release
Makes
.I o/mero
release the hold on the panel (and inner ones).
.TP
.BI look " what
Causes the panel to post an event to the application to look for
.IR  what .
The argument  is terminated by a
newline character. It may be more than a single line of text, and the
convention is to replace ew lines within the argument with the SOH character
(ASCII
.LR 1 ).
.TP
.BI exec  " cmd
Causes the panel to post an event to the application to execute
.IR  cmd .
The argument is handled as in
.B look
regarding newline characters.
.PD
.PP
By default, container panels have the attributes
.BR tag ,
.BR show ,
and
.BR "appl 0 -1" ;
and all other panels have the attributes
.BR notag ,
.BR show ,
and
.BR "appl 0 -1" .
.SS Panels
What follows documents
the list of panels along with the format of their data files and their specific
control requests.
.PP
.I Row
and
.I col
are the two container panels. They contain the
.B order
 attribute (also a control request). Its arguments are the names for the
panels contained in the container. The order of the arguments corresponds
to the order of the panels on the viewer. New panels created inside the container
are added to the end of this attribute.
.PP
.I Image
panels
hold Plan 9 images as data. The size of the panel is that of the image. Its
.B ctl
file contains
.EX
	size nx ny
.EE
besides other attributes, to report the size of the image measured in pixels.
.PP
.I Page
is like
.I image
but grows depending on available space and allows mouse
interaction to see images bigger than the space available.
.PP
.I Text
is a text panel that permits edition. The content of the
.B data
file is the text being edited. See
.IR olive (1),
for a description of the user interaction for this panel.
The following attributes and control requests are specific of text panels:
.TF "sel nm
.TP
.B dirty
Flags the panel to indicate edits not sent to the application  (i.e., unsaved
changes).
.TP
.B clean
The opposite of
.BR dirty .
.TP
.BI sel " n m
Indicates (or sets) the selection to include runes from the
.IR n -th
to the
.IR m -th.
When both values are the same the selection is null and corresponds to the
insertion point for the panel.
.TP
.BI font " F
Sets the font for the panel to
.BR F .
Where
.I F
may be any of
.BR B ,
.BR I ,
.BR L ,
.BR R
.BR S
and
.B T
(bold, italics, large, roman, small, and fixed-width).
.TP
.BI tab " wid
Sets the tab width to
.IR  wid .
.TP
.B usel
permits the panel to update
.B /mnt/snarf/sel
to record the path of the panel with the last selection. This is the default
(but note that none of tags, tables, buttons or labes update that file).
.TP
.B nousel
prevents the panel from updating the last selection file.
.TP
.B scroll
puts the panel in scroll mode (the frame shows the last text added and
it keeps at most 16Kbytes of text).
.TP
.B noscroll
puts the panel in no-scroll mode (the default, keeping all the text
placed in the panel and preserving the position shown by the frame
despite appends of new text).
.TP
.B temp
prevents the panel from becoming dirty. The panel is considered as
scratch space.
.PD
.PP
The following requests are understood for text panels but are not
attributes:
.TF "sel nm
.TP
.BI ins  " tag vers pos text
Inserts
.I text
at position
.I pos
in the panel, but only the the
.B  Qid.vers
for the
.B data
file matches
.IR vers .
.I Tag
is a user chosen identifier sent along with any insert event resulting
from the control request (so that the sender may identify the
operation as its own one).
.TP
.BI del " tag vers pos n
Deletes
.I n
runes starting at position
.I pos
in the text.
.IR  Tag
and
.IR vers
are similar to those of the
.B ins
request.
.PP
.IR Tbl ,
.IR  label ,
.IR  tag ,
and
.I button
panels are similar to
.IR  text .
.PP
.I Gauge
and
.I slider
contain in their
.B data
files a numeric value between 0 and 100 corresponding to a graphical representation
of a gauge.
.PP
.I Draw
is a graphical panel for vector graphics. The
.B data
file contains a textual representation of drawing commands (one per line).
The following commands are understood:
.TP 
.BI ellipse " cx cy rx ry"  [ "w col" ]
Draws a ellipse with center
.RI  ( cx , cy  )
and
.I rx
and
.I ry
as radiuses. The width of the line is
.I w
and the color
is
.I col
(which is a string naming a color; most of the
typical ones are available. See the implementation for a full list.)
.TP
.BI ellipse " cx cy rx ry"  [ "col" ]
is similar but draws a filled ellipse.
.TP
.BI  line " ax ay bx by" [ "ea eb r col" ]
draws a line from
.RI  ( ax , ay )
to
.RI  ( bx , by ).
Arguments
.I ea
and
.I eb
are small integers that
select a line ending at the former and the latter point.
The width of the line is given by
.I r
and
.I col
selects the color for the line.
.TP
.BI rect " ax ay bx by" [ col ]
Draws a rectangle with opposite corners at
.RI  ( ax , ay )
and
.RI  ( bx , by ).
.I Col
selects the color for the lines.
.TP
.BI poly " x0 y0 x1 y1" ... "xn yn e0 en w col
draws a polygon. Arguments indicate the points,
.I E0
and
.I en
indicate endings,
.I w
the line width and
.I col
the color.
.TP
.BI bezspline " x0 y0 x1 y1" ... "xn yn e0 en w col
is similar but draws a spline curve.
.TP
.BI fillpoly " x0 y0 x1 y1" ... "xn yn w col
is like
.B poly
but fills the polygon.
.TP
.BI fillbezspline " x0 y0 x1 y1" ... "xn yn w col
is like
.B bezspline
but fills the region delimited by the spline.
.SS Events
Events are sent using
.IR ports (4).
All events are terminated on a newline character (not considered
part of the event data). By convention, newlines part of the event data
are escaped by replacing them with ASCII
.LR 01 .
All events start with the string
.LR omero: ,
followed by the panel
.I id
(as set using the
.B appl
control request) and the panel path (eg.
.BR /appl/draw:clock ).
.PP
The following events are sent from
.I o/mero
to the application, in response to user interaction or to operations on
the file system.
.IP
.B o/mero:
.I id
.I path
.B look
.I arg
.br

.PP
.B Look
and
.B exec
notify that the user is looking for
.I arg
or tries to execute
.IR arg .
.B Close
notifies that a panel is no longer being viewed. This event is posted
when the last replica is closed (also when the panel files at
.B /appl
are removed).
.PP
.B Click
and
.B keys
report mouse and keyboard activity. This is only done for vector graphics
panels. Keyboard is also reported for non-editable text panels.
.PP
.B Interrupt
notifies the application that the user wants to inerrupt it.
.PP
.B Clean
and
.B dirty
report that panel does not have  (or does) unsaved changes.
