.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ports
provides text event delivery through its file interface. It serves
a directory with a
.B post
file that can be used to post events.
By default it mounts itself at
.B /mnt/ui
unless flag
.B -m
is used to request mounting at
.I mnt
or flag
.B -i
is used to request reaching the client through
standard input. Flags
.B -abc
are similar to those of
.IR mount (1).
.PP
Each
.IR write (2)
on the
.B post
file is considered an event. Events are supposed to be small enough to fit in a single write, and
they are handled as strings by
.IR ports .
All events should terminate with a new-line character. Multiple events can be written together.
.PP
To listen for events, additional files may be created in the directory served. Each file created
represents a listener for events. Once created, a regular expression in the format supported by
.IR regex (2)
must be written to the file, to program it to listen for matching events. Events written to
.B post
but not matching this regular expression will be ignored (for this file). The regular expression can
be changed by further writes, but it will not affect events already queued for delivery.
.PP
Each read request for a listener file will return a single event by default. This can be changed by
writing
.L multi
to the file. In this case, all queued events that fit in the read buffer will be delivered for a single request
(without splitting events between multiple reads).
.PP
Events are queued up to a
maximum of 128 events (or
.I n
if
.B -q
is given in the command line). Should the queue become full (due to a slow event reader client),
old events will be discarded.
.PP
Note that listener files do not need to be open during the entire process. That is, an application
may create a listener file, close it, reopen it, write a regular expression, close it, reopen it,
and loop reading events. This is done so to simplify the use of ports from shell scripts and to
admit protocols like Op.
.PP
When a program does not read events for more than one minute, and the queue for the listener
file is full, it is considered an error and the listener file is removed.
.PP
If a file with name
.B unsent
is created, events not posted to any other file will be delivered to it. This file can be used to detect
events not received by anyone else.
