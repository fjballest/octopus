.TH SNARF 4
.SH NAME
snarf \- shared clipboard file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B o/snarf
[
.B \-abcd

.B -m
.I mnt

.B ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Snarf
is a file server that mounts itself above
.B /chan
to intercept I/O to
.B /chan/snarf
and maintain a shared clipboard. But note
that it does not bind above
.B /dev
(so that
.B /dev/snarf
still refers to the local clipboard). The program
assumes that
.IR snarf (3)
is already bound if needed.
.PP
The clipboard is kept at
.B /mnt/snarf/buffer
which is expected to be a file shared among
the cooperating machines.
.PP
When
.B /chan/snarf
is written
.I snarf
updates the shared clipboard and the local
one and then posts an event to
.IR ports (4)
with the string
.B /mnt/snarf/buffer
to let others know of the update.
When
.I snarf
receives such event it reads the
shared clipboard and updates the local one.
.PP
Flag
.B -m
can be used to ask
.I snarf
to mount itself at
.IR mnt .
Options
.B -abc
determine the mount flag, as in
.IR bind (1).
Flag
.B -d
is used to debug the program, and makes it very verbose.
