.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B attach
message reports the user responsible for the connection to the file server, and
picks a particular subtree of the server's file tree.
Future transactions are performed on behalf of that user. In such transactions, the path
named
.B /
corresponds to the file identified by the
.B path
field in this transaction. Usually,
.B /
is used to attach to the entire tree.
.PP
This transaction may be used only once, prior to any further communication
through the channel. Servers must refuse to attand any other transaction until receiving this one.

.PP
Authentication is outside the protocol, and should determine that
.I uname
corresponds indeed to the user holding that user name.
.SH ENTRY POINTS
An
.B attach
transaction will be generated exactly once, while mounting an Op file server.
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR bind (2).
.SH BUGS
The
.B path
field is not implemented by the only server implemented that speaks
this protocol.
