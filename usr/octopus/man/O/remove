.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.B remove
message asks the server to remove the file identified by
.IR path .
See
.IR intro (O)
for a description of that field.
.PP
The user must have write permission in the directory containing the file. An attempt
to remove the root directory of the server should always fail.
.PP
File descriptors used for Put and Get transactions, which point to the removed file, would still be
valid after a Remove transaction. The client should terminate those descriptors besides removing
the file, but that may be done asynchronously with respect to the remove request.
.SH ENTRY POINTS
A
.B remove
transaction will be generated from
.B Tremove
requests from STYX, resulting from
.IR remove (2)
calls.
.SH SEE ALSO
